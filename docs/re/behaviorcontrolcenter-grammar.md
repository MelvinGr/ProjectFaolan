# BehaviorControlCenterIIR_c (0x642CD3D6) wire grammar — "BccIIR"

Recovered from `AgeOfConan.exe` (Ghidra). The Behavior Control Center IIR is the NPC/player **behavior
command** carrier (the combat/interact "BccAck"). Gitea #190.

## Reader — `BehaviorControlCenterIIR_c::ReadSubClass` (`FUN_005e24e0`)

```
[u8 behaviorType]        (+0x1c)   # selects the command form
switch (behaviorType):
  2,3,4,5,7,10,0xF,0x10,0x12 : [u32 commandId] -> look up the Command (FUN_007dcd60), then the Command's own
                               reader (vtable slot 0x80) reads its behavior-specific data
  6,8,9,0xD,0x11             : (terminal - no extra read)
  0xB,0xC                    : [u32] (+0x28)
  0xE                        : [u32 a (+0x24)] ; if a != 0 -> [u32 commandId] -> Command reader
  default                    : (nothing)
```

So a BccIIR = `[u8 type][u32 commandId?][command-specific data]`, where the command data is read by the
looked-up Command object's reader (another vtable hop). The combat-relevant forms (the attack/interact ack)
are already built byte-exact by `CombatService`/`BehaviorControlCenterCodec` (`BehaviorAcksTests`).

## Status

Grammar SHAPE decoded (type switch + commandId + per-command reader). A fully constructive codec needs the
per-Command readers (vtable slot 0x80 of each Command type) enumerated - the residue; the combat path is done.

## Registration form (the create-burst / world-entry BccIIR) — #234

Distinct from the combat BccAck above: the create-world cutscene and world-entry bursts REGISTER behaviors on
scene entities with a fixed-shape record (decoded by `tools/capture/decode_behaviorcc.py`, built by
`BehaviorAnimations.Registration`):

```
[u32 C350][u32 handle][u16 form][u32 slot][u32 msgLen][protobuf][optional tail]
  form     = 0x0004 (common) | 0x0007 (rarer subtype: adds protobuf field 4, a varint)
  protobuf = base varints  f1=behaviorId  f3=phase  f5=field5  f6=field6
             + OPTIONAL     f2, f11, f12        (wire order: 1,[2],3,5,6,[11],[12])
  tail     = 0 | 20-byte "bound" [u32 boundA][u32 boundB][12x 00] | 88-byte item-bound long form
```

Form census across the hoxxling create-world cutscene (90 records): 41x {1,3,5,6,12} no-tail, 34x {1,3,5,6}
no-tail, 7x {1,3,5,6,12}+bound20, 4x {1,3,5,6,11,12}+bound20, 1x {1,3,5,6}+bound20, 1x {1,2,3,5,6,12}+bound20,
1x {1,3,5,6}+long88, 1x form=0x0007. `BehaviorAnimations.Registration` constructs every form-0x0004 record (base + optional 2/4/11/12 + 20-byte bound
tail) AND the 0x0007 subtype (via `form: 0x0007` + `field4`); `BehaviorAnimations.ItemRegistration` builds the
88-byte item-bound form (its trailing 3 u32 parameterized for the cutscene's non-zero state). All 90 cutscene
records are now constructed byte-exact (the #234 golden harness locks them).
